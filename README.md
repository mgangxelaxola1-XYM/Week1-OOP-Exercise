# Week1-OOP-Exercise

This project helped me understand the basics of OOP. I worked with classes and objects by creating different classes like Student, BankAccount, Circle, and Rectangle, then made objects from them in my main program. Each class represents something from real life and has its own job to do.
I learned about encapsulation by using properties with different access levels. For example, in the BankAccount class, I made the Balance property have a private setter so nobody can just change the balance directly from outside the class. The StudentManager class also has a private list of students that can only be changed through the class methods.
I got to practice using constructors to set up my objects properly when they're created. Every class has a constructor that makes sure the object starts with the right data. The BankAccount constructor even checks that you can't start with a negative balance.
The project also taught me about interfaces and polymorphism. I created an IShape interface that both Circle and Rectangle implement. They each have their own way of calculating area, but I can treat them the same way in my code because they follow the same interface. This was really cool to see in action in the shapes demo.
I also learned about method overriding when I changed how the ToString() method works in my Student class so it displays student info nicely. I practiced working with collections by using a List to store students and doing things like adding, removing, and searching through them.
Throughout the code, I tried to keep things organized by putting related classes into their own namespaces like StudentModule, BankModule, and ShapeModule. I also added validation to make sure users can't do things like deposit negative amounts or withdraw more money than they have.
